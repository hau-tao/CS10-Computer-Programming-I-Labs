cs010_practice
==============

The CS010(v) practice repository is used to set up a students Cloud 9 public 
workspace to be used in collaboration with other students.

The practice workspace has been created to provide a place for students to
play with code and collaborate with other students on CodeLab, Zyante and
lecture concepts. Share your workspace with other students and start figuring
out C++ together.

Remember that assignments are to be done on your own and should not be shared
with other students. Practice programing concepts can be used here, but not the
assignment.
